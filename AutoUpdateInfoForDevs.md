# DEVS: THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO TO PROVIDE A NEW UPDATE #

  * commit your revision to svn
  * svn update your local code and compile again so the svn version in the dol is right
  * delete the deprecated downloads for "current.txt" and "current.dol"
  * edit your copy of "current.txt" to the correct svn version and add your update details
  * rename your newly compiled dol to "current.dol"
  * add new deprecated downloads for "current.txt" and "current.dol"

Use "deprecated" downloads as it hides them from the general list.
