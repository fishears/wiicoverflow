  * Q: Game xxx doesn't work
  * A: Not all games work, in addition try using the game fix options to see if that resolves your issue.  The fix options can get some games, which don't normally work, to play.  Conversely if you don't need the fix, don't use it - you can stop games from working.
  * Q: The loader exited during startup
  * A: Because of the buffering mechanism used the loader may exit it one of the images is "bad" or has an unexpected size.  Check all your images against the expected sizes (Cover 160x224, Disk 160x160, 3D Cover 512x340) if one of these is not the correct size or cannot be viewed in a graphics application it may crash the loader.
