## Now Hiring! ##
If you are interested in taking the lead on this project, let us know! We are looking for active developers with an interest in wii development!

## About ##
CoverFloader is a USB ISO Loader for Nintendo Wii. It currently supports loading game images from a [WBFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBFS) partition using the latest cIOSX (currently understood to be rev20). You can copy your original Nintendo Wii Game Discs to a USB Storage device and then access your whole library of games without  needing to change discs. All within a rich, user-friendly interface.

## Donate ##
You can support CoverFloader by supporting others; a donation to CoverFloader not only shows you support open source development but goes directly to help [Orphans in Haiti](http://www.ahbz.org)  (Seriously, every dollar donated gets re-donated to our favorite Orphanage).
